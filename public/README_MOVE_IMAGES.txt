You should move the following files from `src/assets/` to your `public/` folder for correct image loading in your footer and other sections:

- footer-background-pattern.png
- aangan-logo-mark.svg
- aangan-text-logo.png
- facebook.png
- insta.png
- linkedin.png

After moving, update all `src` attributes in your code to use `/filename.ext` (e.g., `/aangan-logo-mark.svg`).

Would you like me to update your code to use the correct public paths for all these images?
